2. Using SSH to connect the serve. Reset the passwords first and then connect to our account. We could see some user and time here.  
   Following are step   

        //We will using following command
        $ ssh cs15lwi23amq@ieng6.ucsd.edu
        //Then Type Passwords

    Then we will see user name, cpu usage, cluster status amd the login time here. I find the Hostname are same among us, however the load and averages time are different, maybe it caused by internet connection.
